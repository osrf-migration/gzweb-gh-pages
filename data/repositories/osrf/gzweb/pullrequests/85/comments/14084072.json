I tried it like this:\n\n1. Insert a kitchen and put a box inside it.\n\n1. Set the kitchen to be wireframe\n\n1. The kitchen is still selectable as wireframe, the box is selectable from an angle which doesn't hit the kitchen before\n\n1. Set the kitchen back to normal display, and both models are still selectable\n\nI get this behaviour with the default branch and with your patch. Am I looking for the problem in the wrong place?\n\nIn any case, not having a separate geometry for the wireframe is nice!
